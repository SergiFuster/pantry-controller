Pour the mixture into a baking dish and top it with some frozen vegetables (such as peas, carrots, or corn). Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the quinoa is tender."

"Description: A fun twist on the classic grilled cheese sandwich, this recipe adds a layer of sweet and savory goodness. Butter two slices of bread on one side each. Place one slice, butter-side down, in a pan over medium heat. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese and sliced apples on top of the bread. Once the cheese starts to melt, place the other slice of bread, butter-side up, on top of the filling. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until the bread is golden brown."}
